## Goals

Try to implement a tiny language but full dev stack.

- JS is our C++
- no dependencies
- pico JS implementation
- it's fun and easy to follow

## Today

- [ ] simple lexer (tokenazier)
- [ ] simple parser (produces AST)
- [ ] context aware errors

## Later

- [ ] extend lexer and parser with conditionals
- [ ] implement AST evaluator
- [ ] add some syntax highlighting
- [ ] primitive type checking
- [ ] bytecode emission and execution
- [ ] VSCode language server
